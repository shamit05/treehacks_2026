You are identifying the EXACT UI element in a zoomed screenshot crop.

The user wants to: {{INSTRUCTION}}
Target element: "{{LABEL}}"

You are shown TWO images of the same zoomed region:
1. An annotated crop with colored numbered bounding boxes on detected UI elements.
2. The same crop WITHOUT any boxes, so you can read text and icons clearly.

DETECTED ELEMENTS (numbered boxes in image 1):
{{ELEMENTS_CONTEXT}}

YOUR TASK:
1. Look at image 2 (clean) to read the actual text/icons in this region.
2. Look at image 1 (annotated) to see which numbered box covers the target element.
3. The target is: "{{LABEL}}" — find the numbered box that covers this element.
4. If multiple boxes are near the target, pick the one whose border most tightly wraps it.

Output ONLY this JSON:
{
  "element_id": <int: the box number covering the target element>,
  "box_2d": [<ymin>, <xmin>, <ymax>, <xmax>] on 0-1000 scale relative to THIS crop,
  "confidence": <float 0-1>,
  "reasoning": "<which boxes you considered, why you picked this one>"
}
