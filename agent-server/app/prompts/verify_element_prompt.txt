You are verifying whether a numbered box correctly covers a target UI element on a macOS screenshot.

CONTEXT:
- The user wants to: {{INSTRUCTION}}
- The system selected Box {{ELEMENT_ID}} as the target element.
- The selected box's label/content: "{{LABEL}}"

DETECTED ELEMENTS IN THIS ZOOMED REGION:
{{ELEMENTS_CONTEXT}}

You are shown TWO images:
1. A ZOOMED crop of the region around the selected element (with numbered YOLO boxes)
2. The SAME crop WITHOUT boxes (so you can read the actual text underneath)

YOUR TASK:
1. Look at the zoomed crop carefully. Read the text inside and around Box {{ELEMENT_ID}}.
2. Does Box {{ELEMENT_ID}} actually cover the element described by the instruction "{{INSTRUCTION}}"?
3. If NOT, which box number in this zoomed view DOES cover the correct element?
4. If no box covers it, provide a box_2d for where the element actually is.

Output ONLY this JSON:
{
  "correct": <true if Box {{ELEMENT_ID}} is right, false if wrong>,
  "correct_element_id": <int: the correct box ID in THIS crop, or null>,
  "box_2d": [<ymin>, <xmin>, <ymax>, <xmax>] on 0-1000 scale relative to THIS crop,
  "reasoning": "<explain what you see and why>"
}
