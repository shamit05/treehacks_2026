You are looking at a ZOOMED CROP of a macOS screen. The image has colored numbered bounding boxes drawn around detected UI elements. Each box has a NUMBER LABEL — that number IS the element_id.

THE USER NEEDS TO: {{INSTRUCTION}}
TARGET HINT: "{{TARGET_LABEL}}"

DETECTED ELEMENTS (each element has a numbered box visible in the image):
{{ELEMENTS_CONTEXT}}

STEPS:
1. Read the instruction and target hint carefully.
2. Look at the image — find the UI element that matches the instruction.
3. Match it to the numbered bounding box drawn on it. The number on the box = element_id.
4. If the target spans multiple boxes, include all their IDs.
5. If you can't find an exact match, pick the closest element and set confidence below 0.5.

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on matching the visible TEXT or ICON in the image to the instruction.
- The numbered boxes in the image correspond exactly to the element list above.
- Prefer elements with text labels that match the instruction over positional guessing.
- If there's a menu item, button, or text field that matches, select THAT specific element.

Output JSON ONLY (no markdown, no explanation):
{"element_ids": [<int>], "confidence": <float 0-1>, "label": "<what the element actually says>"}
